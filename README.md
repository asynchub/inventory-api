# inventory-api
# AWS CDK TypeScript

First commit evolved from previous projects:
* items-api
* solution-api

Stack and project structure inspired by examples from:
* serverless-stack
* AppSync
* Amplify

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute the app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
